To enable Report Designer localization, we provide resource files. The string resources include keys for all UI areas. This includes all backstage items, ribbon items, wizards, editors, enum descriptions, and properties.  

We provide reference translations for some popular languages for which we have partially used Azure Cognitive Services. To edit the provided resx reference files, use Visual Studio or a resx editing tool of your choice. In order to merge your changes with the newer release resource, create a pull request to this repository. Any pull requests will be carefully reviewed and included in the next release.
