The resource files in this directory are needed to enable Report Designer localization. The string resources include keys for all UI areas. This includes all backstage items, ribbon items, wizards, editors, enum descriptions, and properties.  

These are reference translations for some popular languages for which we have partially used Azure Cognitive Services. To edit the provided resx reference files, use Visual Studio or a resx editing tool of your choice. In order to modify or add new translations create a pull request to this repository.

The resources are updated when a new product release introduces new or changed keys in the resources.
